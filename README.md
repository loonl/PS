# Problem Solving (PS)
This is a place to store my problem solving codes. You can find more informations below.

## What is Problem Solving? 
Problem solving in CS is the process of transforming the description of a problem into a solution by using computer. We analyze the problem and type a code in order to create a solution for specific problems.

## When did I start?
I have been doing this since 2021.02.02.
